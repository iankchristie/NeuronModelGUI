# NeuronModelGUI
## Graphical User Interface for Designing Neuronal Circuits

While I was doing a lot of modeling I came across two problems:
* It was time consuming and error prone to create models via code.
* It was difficult to communicate how models worked


The solution to this was a graphical model creation and visualization tool. It was a Java Applet that used drag-and-drop design to create the model in a 2D space and JFreeChart libraries to visualize output of simulations. It also allows for serialization and easy sharing of models created.

It was used in my lab and as teaching tool in some classes for visualizing neuronal networks. More behind the math and modeling can be found here: http://cns-classes.bu.edu/cn510/Papers/Theoretical%20Neuroscience%20Computational%20and%20Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Neural%20Systems%20-%20%20Peter%20Dayan,%20L.%20F.%20Abbott.pdf
